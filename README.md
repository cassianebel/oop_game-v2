# Phrase Hunter

A word guessing game that uses JavaScript and OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) to select a random, hidden phrase, which a player tries to guess, by clicking letters on an onscreen keyboard.

## Style Changes

- Used different font-weights throughout content and gave the h2 an italic style
- Used different colors throughout content
- Animated gradient background for the initial overlay screen
- Added border to the hover/focus/active state of buttons
- Shaped the unchosen 'keys' as circles, but kept the chosen 'keys' as squares to further differentiate the two for the user
- Phrase letters have shadows to add depth (drop shadow when animating in, inset shadow once in place)
- When a 'correct' key is chosen the corresponding letters in the phrase animate in a fun jumping out at you motion to alert the user to the newly unmasked letters
- When a 'wrong' key is chosen it is animated to shake like a 'no' gesture
- When the game is finished the win/lose message animates in
